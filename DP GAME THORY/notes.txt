Suppose there are two player Alice and Bob where both are playing optimally 



steps tp solve 

1. define the state 
  f(p,other changing parameters) where p is the the turn where 0 means it is the turn of Alice
  
  
2 transition
  for alice
  f(0,other parameter) = max(s + f(1,Other parameter)) s ----> means that adding parameter
  maximum over all the value
  
  
  for bob => p = 1
  f(1,other parameter) = min(f(0,other parameter))   minimize the score of bob so that Alice can get more points
