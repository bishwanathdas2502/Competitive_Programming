Suppose there are two player Alice and Bob where both are playing optimally 



steps tp solve 

1. define the state 
  f(p,other changing parameters) where p is the the turn where 0 means it is the turn of Alice
  
  
2 transition
  for alice
  f(0,other parameter) = max(s + f(1,Other parameter)) s ----> means that adding parameter
  maximum over all the value
  
  
  for bob => p = 1
  f(1,other parameter) = min(f(0,other parameter))   minimize the score of bob so that Alice can get more points 
  donot add any result
  
  derive the answer by calculating what is optimal for alice from that derive for BOB


1st              2nd
DP[x] --------- DP[x-a]
      --------- DP[x-b]
      --------- DP[x-c]

if any of 2nd stage is loosing the Dp[x] is winning
if all state in 2nd stage is winning the DP[x] is loosing
