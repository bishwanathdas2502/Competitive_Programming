Sometimes the question used to ask for optimal permutation of an array based on certain constraints


intuition

---> in recursion pick element and recursively solve the left and right and merge them


let array = [a,b,c,d]

solution like
dp[left][right] = min(dp[left][k] + dp[k][right] + cost)


pseudocode
--------------------
int f(int left,int right){
//base case
if(left > right)return 0;


for(int i = left;i<=right;i++)
{ 
  //solve left
  int left_cost = f(left,i-1);
  
  //solve right
  int right_cost = f(i+1,right)
  
  //merge all cost
  
  cost = min(cost,left_cost+right_cost+merge_cost)
  
}


in this we are indirectly finding the optimal permutation
